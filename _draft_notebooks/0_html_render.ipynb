       "* This Application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/232,871, filed Sep. 25, 2015; which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n",
       "FIELD OF THE INVENTION* The field of the present invention relates to antibodies that bind to pembrolizumab and methods of using such antibodies, for example, for detecting the presence of anti-drug antibodies in a sample.\n",
       "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION* The possibility exists that some therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies, have immunogenic potential, and administration of the therapeutic proteins to a patient sometimes results in the production of antibodies against the therapeutic protein. Such anti-drug antibodies (ADA) may reduce the effectiveness of the therapeutic protein; for example, they may bind to or/and neutralize the therapeutic protein, resulting in changes of drug pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics that alters drug efficacy. ADA may cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions, cross-reactivity against endogenous proteins, and complement activation. A life-threatening deficiency syndrome can result if ADA cross-reacts with and neutralizes a critical endogenous protein. Thus, assays and reagents for determining the presence of ADAs in a sample for a patient who has received an antibody therapy, such as pembrolizumab, is of great interest.\n",

       "* The present invention provides antibodies that cross-block binding of the antibodies set forth herein (e.g., A30514, A30523 or A30633) from binding to pembrolizumab. The cross-blocking antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof discussed herein can be identified based on their ability to block any of the antibodies or fragments specifically set forth herein (e.g., A30514, A30523 or A30633), from binding to pembrolizumab in binding assays (e.g., bio-layer interferometry (BLI; for example FORTEBIO OCTET binding assay; Pall ForteBio Corp; Menlo Park, Calif.), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), BIACore, ELISA, flow cytometry). For example, in an embodiment of the invention, when using BLI, the tip of a fiber-optic probe is coated with ligand (e.g., pembrolizumab) and acts as the biosensor wherein binding of anti-pembrolizumab antibody or antigen-binding fragment to the pembrolizumab alters the interference pattern of white light reflected from the probe layer bound to pembrolizumab and an internal reference layer. The shift is indicative of pembrolizumab/anti-pembrolizumab binding. In an embodiment of the invention, the pembrolizumab coated tip is immersed in a solution of analyte containing antibody or antigen-binding fragment, e.g., in the well of either a 96- or 384-well plate. In an embodiment of the invention, the plate is shaken during reading to create orbital flow. To read the assay, white light is directed down the length of the fiber. As mentioned above, interference between light reflecting off the reference layer and immobilized surfaces containing pembrolizumab of the tip creates a distinctive pattern of light returning up the fiber. As molecules bind to the immobilized sensor surface, that pattern changes in proportion to the extent of binding. For example, assays can be used in which pembrolizumab is immobilized on a BLI probe or plate, a reference anti-pembrolizumab antibody or fragment binds to pembrolizumab (e.g., at saturating concentration) and a test anti-pembrolizumab antibody or fragment is added. The ability of the test antibody to compete with the reference antibody for pembrolizumab binding is then determined. In the BLI format, light interference of the pembrolizumab complex is monitored to determine if the test antibody effectively competes with the reference antibody, e.g., nanometers of light wavelength shift over time is monitored wherein a shift indicates additional binding of the test antibody and a lack of cross-blocking. In an embodiment of the invention, in the BLI format, cross-blocking is qualitatively deemed to have occurred between the antibodies if no additional binding of test antibody is observed. In an embodiment of the invention, as a control, cross-blocking of the reference antibody with itself is confirmed; wherein the assay is determined to be operating correctly if the reference antibody can cross-block itself from pembrolizumab binding. The ability of a test antibody to inhibit the binding of, for example, A30633, to pembrolizumab demonstrates that the test antibody can cross-block A30633 for binding to pembrolizumab and thus, may, in some cases, bind to the same epitope on pembrolizumab as A30633. As stated above, antibodies and fragments that bind to the same epitope as any of the anti-pembrolizumab antibodies or fragments of the present invention also form part of the present invention. In an embodiment of the invention, BLI is conducted in a sandwich format wherein a reference anti-pembrolizumab antibody or antigen-binding fragment is immobilized to the probe and then bound with pembrolizumab. Test anti-pembrolizumab antibody or antigen-binding fragment is then tested for the ability to block binding of the references antibody or fragment.\n",

       "* The present invention includes anti-pembrolizumab scFv fragments and methods of use thereof. The term âsingle-chain Fvâ or âscFvâ antibody refers to antibody fragments comprising the VH and VL domains of an antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen-binding. For a review of scFv, see Pluckthun (1994) THE PHARMACOLOGY OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315.

The two VH regions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the same or different antigens.\n",
       "* The present invention includes anti-pembrolizumab bivalent antibodies and methods of use thereof. A âbivalent antibodyâ comprises two antigen-binding sites. In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However, bivalent antibodies may be bispecific (see below).\n",
       "* The present invention includes anti-pembrolizumab nanobodies or single-domain antibodies. For example, anti-pembrolizumab antibodies of the present invention may be modified so as to prevent dimerization or aggregation such that nanobodies or single-domain antibodies are produced.\n",
       "* The present invention includes anti-pembrolizumab diabodies and methods of use thereof. As used herein, the term âdiabodiesâ refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-VL or VL-VH). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Holliger et al. (1993) *Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA* 90: 6444-6448. For a review of engineered antibody variants generally see Holliger and Hudson (2005) *Nat. Biotechnol.* 23:1126-1136.\n",
       "* Typically, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention which is modified in some way retains at least 10% of its pembrolizumab-binding activity (when compared to the parental antibody) when that activity is expressed on a molar basis. Preferably, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention retains at least 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% or more of the pembrolizumab binding affinity as the parental antibody. It is also intended that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention can include conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions (referred to as âconservative variantsâ or âfunction conserved variantsâ of the antibody) that do not substantially alter its biologic activity.\n",
       "* The present invention includes monoclonal anti-pembrolizumab antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof as well as monoclonal compositions comprising a plurality of isolated monoclonal antibodies. The term âmonoclonal antibodyâ, as used herein, refers to a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the antibody molecules comprising the population are identical in amino acid sequence except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. A âpluralityâ of such monoclonal antibodies and fragments in a composition refers to a concentration of identical (i.e., as discussed above, in amino acid sequence except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts) antibodies and fragments which is above that which would normally occur in nature, e.g., in the blood of a host organism such as a mouse or a human. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of different antibodies having different amino acid sequences in their variable domains, particularly their CDRs, that are often specific for different epitopes. The modifier âmonoclonalâ indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) *Nature* 256: 495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The âmonoclonal antibodiesâ may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991) *Nature* 352: 624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597, for example. See also Presta (2005) *J. Allergy Clin. lmmunol.* 116:731.\n",
       "* The present invention includes anti-pembrolizumab chimeric antibodies (e.g., human constant domain/mouse variable domain) and methods of use thereof. As used herein, a âchimeric antibodyâ is an antibody having the variable domain from a first antibody and the constant domain from a second antibody, where the first and second antibodies are from different species. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., (1984) *Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA* 81: 6851-6855). Typically, the variable domains are obtained from an antibody from an experimental animal (the âparental antibodyâ), such as a rodent or a rabbit, and the constant domain sequences are obtained from human antibodies (e.g., immunoglobulin E constant domain), so that the resulting chimeric antibody will be less likely to elicit an adverse immune response in a human subject than the parental (e.g., rabbit) antibody. Thus, the present invention includes anti-pembrolizumab antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof comprising a rabbit heavy and light chain variable domain of A30514, A30523 or A30633 linked to a human constant domain. In an embodiment of the invention, the human heavy chain constant domain is an IgE.\n",
       "* The present invention includes anti-pembrolizumab humanized antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof (e.g., mouse antibodies that have been humanized) and methods of use thereof. As used herein, the term âhumanized antibodyâ refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from both human and non-human (e.g., rabbit) antibodies. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the framework (FR) regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody may optionally comprise at least a portion of a human immunoglobulin constant region (Fc).\n",
       "* In general, the basic antibody structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer includes two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one âlightâ (about 25 kDa) and one âheavyâ chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chain may define a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Typically, human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Furthermore, human heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a âJâ region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a âDâ region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, *Fundamental Immunology* Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989).\n",
       "* In an embodiment of the invention, anti-pembrolizumab antibodies of the present invention comprise a full tetrameric structure having two light chains and two heavy chains, including constant regions.\n",
       "* The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site. Thus, in general, an intact antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are, in general, the same.\n",
       "* Typically, the variable domains of both the heavy and light chains comprise three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions (CDRs), located within relatively conserved framework regions (FR). The CDRs are usually aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. In general, from N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains variable domains comprise FR1, CDR1, FR2 , CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is, generally, in accordance with the definitions of *Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest*, Kabat, et al.; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. ; 5th ed.; a NIH Publ.

       "* As used herein, the term âhypervariable regionâ refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a âcomplementarity determining regionâ or âCDRâ (i.e. CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 in the light chain variable domain and CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 in the heavy chain variable domain).

For example, for purposes of this disclosure, it should be understood that âa polynucleotide comprisingâ a particular nucleotide sequence does not encompass intact chromosomes. Isolated polynucleotide âcomprisingâ specified nucleotide sequences may include, in addition to the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to ten or even up to twenty or more other proteins or portions or fragments thereof, or may include operably linked regulatory sequences that control expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid sequences, and/or may include vector sequences. As is discussed below, the present invention includes isolated polynucleotides encoding any of the immunoglobulin chains discussed herein.\n",
       "* The phrase âcontrol sequencesâ refers to DNA sequences necessary or useful for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to use promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n",
       "* A nucleic acid or polynucleotide is âoperably linkedâ when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, but not always, âoperably linkedâ means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking may be accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n",

A first polynucleotide molecule is âhybridizableâ to a second polynucleotide molecule when a single stranded form of the first polynucleotide molecule can anneal to the second polynucleotide molecule under the appropriate conditions of temperature and solution ionic strength (see Sambrook, et al., supra). The conditions of temperature and ionic strength determine the âstringencyâ of the hybridization. Typical low stringency hybridization conditions include 55Â° C., 5ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS and no formamide; or 30% formamide, 5ÃSSC, 0.5% SDS at 42Â° C. Typical moderate stringency hybridization conditions are 40% formamide, with 5Ãor 6ÃSSC and 0.1% SDS at 42Â° C. High stringency hybridization conditions are 50% formamide, 5Ã or 6ÃSSC at 42Â° C. or, optionally, at a higher temperature (e.g., 57Â° C., 59Â° C., 60Â° C., 62Â° C., 63Â° C., 65Â° C. or 68Â° C.). In general, SSC is 0.15M NaCl and 0.015M Na-citrate. Hybridization requires that the two polynucleotide contain complementary sequences, although, depending on the stringency of the hybridization, mismatches between bases are possible. The appropriate stringency for hybridizing polynucleotides depends on the length of the polynucleotides and the degree of complementation, variables well known in the art. The greater the degree of similarity or homology between two nucleotide sequences, the higher the stringency under which the nucleic acids may hybridize. For hybrids of greater than 100 nucleotides in length, equations for calculating the melting temperature have been derived (see Sambrook, et al., supra, 9.50-9.51). For hybridization with shorter polynucleotides, e.g., oligonucleotides, the position of mismatches becomes more important, and the length of the oligonucleotide determines its specificity (see Sambrook, et al., supra, 11.7-11.8).\n",
       "* In another embodiment of the invention, a polynucleotide, for example DNA, encoding the immunoglobulin polypeptide chains of the anti-pembrolizumab antibodies or antigen-binding fragments set forth herein forms part of the present invention.

       "Methods for Making* The present invention includes methods for making an anti-pembrolizumab antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention, or an immunoglobulin chain thereof, comprising (i) introducing a polynucleotide encoding one or more immunoglobulin chains of the antibody or fragment (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 7-12, 31 and/or 33 or any of those discussed herein), for example, wherein the polynucleotide is in a vector and/or is operably linked to a promoter; (ii) culturing the host cell (e.g., CHO or *Pichia* or *Pichia pastoris*) under condition favorable to expression of the polynucleotide and, (iii) optionally, isolating the antibody or fragment or chain from the host cell and/or medium in which the host cell is grown. When making an antibody or antigen-binding fragment comprising more than one immunoglobulin chain, e.g., an antibody that comprises two heavy immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains, co-expression of the chains in a single host cell leads to association of the chains, e.g., in the cell or on the cell surface or outside the cell if such chains are secreted, so as to form the antibody or antigen-binding fragment molecule. The methods include those wherein only a heavy immunoglobulin chain is expressed or only a light immunoglobulin chain is expressed or both heavy and light chains are expressed (e.g., any of those discussed herein including mature fragments and/or variable domains thereof). In embodiments wherein heavy and light immunoglobulin chains are expressed, the chains can be expressed from two separate polynucleotide molecules or from a single polynucleotide molecule.\n",
       "* Single unpaired immunoglobulin chains are useful, for example, as intermediates in the expression of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment that includes such a chain.\n",
       "* Anti-pembrolizumab antibodies can also be synthesized by any of the methods set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,331,415.\n",
       "* Eukaryotic and prokaryotic host cells, including mammalian cells as hosts for expression of the anti-pembrolizumab antibodies or fragments or immunoglobulin chains disclosed herein, are well known in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). These include, inter alia, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, NSO, SP2 cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), A549 cells, 3T3 cells, HEK-293 cells and a number of other cell lines. Mammalian host cells include human, mouse, rat, dog, monkey, pig, goat, bovine, horse and hamster cells. Host cells also include those which have been selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels. Other cell lines that may be used are insect cell lines (e.g., *Spodoptera frugiperda* or *Trichoplusia ni*), amphibian cells, bacterial cells, plant cells and fungal cells. Fungal cells include yeast and filamentous fungus cells including, for example, *Pichia pastoris, Pichia finlandica, Pichia trehalophila, Pichia koclamae, Pichia membranaefaciens, Pichia minuta* (*Ogataea minuta, Pichia lindneri*), *Pichia opuntiae, Pichia thermotolerans, Pichia salictaria, Pichia guercuum, Pichia pijperi, Pichia stiptis, Pichia methanolica, Pichia* sp., *Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces* sp., *Hansenula polymorpha, Kluyveromyces* sp., *Kluyveromyces lactis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Trichoderma reesei, Chrysosporium lucknowense, Fusarium* sp., *Fusarium gramineum, Fusarium venenatum, Physcomitrella patens* and *Neurospora crassa.

       "* Further, expression of antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof and immunoglobulin chains of the invention (or other moieties therefrom) from production cell lines can be enhanced using a number of known techniques. For example, the glutamine synthetase gene expression system (the GS system) is a common approach for enhancing expression under certain conditions.

Thus, in an embodiment of the invention, the mammalian host cells (e.g., CHO) lack a glutamine synthetase gene and are grown in the absence of glutamine in the medium wherein, however, the polynucleotide encoding the immunoglobulin chain comprises a glutamine synthetase gene which complements the lack of the gene in the host cell. The present invention includes methods for purifying an anti-pembrolizumab antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention comprising introducing a sample (e.g., culture medium, cell lysate or cell lysate fraction, e.g., a soluble fraction of the lysate) comprising the antibody or fragment to a purification medium (e.g., cation-exchange medium, anion-exchange medium, hydrophobic exchange medium, affinity purification medium (e.g., protein-A, protein-G, protein-A/C, protein-L)) and either collecting purified antibody or fragment from the flow-through fraction of said sample that does not bind to the medium; or, discarding the flow-through fraction and eluting bound antibody or fragment from the medium and collecting the eluate. In an embodiment of the invention, the medium is in a column to which the sample is applied. In an embodiment of the invention, the purification method is conducted following recombinant expression of the antibody or fragment in a host cell, e.g., wherein the host cell is first lysed and, optionally, the lysate is purified of insoluble materials prior to purification on a medium; or wherein the antibody or fragment is secreted into the culture medium by the host cell and the medium or a fraction thereof is applied to the purification medium.\n",

In this assay, the biotinylated pembrolizumab was used as the capture and ruthenylated anti-human IgE was used as the detector. Initially, the biotinylated pembrolizumab at 100 ng/mL was added to a MesoScale Discovery (MSD) 96 well plate coated with streptavidin, and incubated for approximately an hour. After the removal of unbound Biotinylated pembrolizumab, the chimeric anti-pembrolizumab IgE at different concentrations were added to the wells, and allowed for overnight incubation at 4Â° C. On day 2, the wells were washed to remove the unbound samples, followed by the addition of ruthenylated anti-human IgE at 200ng/mL. After an hour of incubation, the wells were washed, and lx Read buffer was added before analyzed by MSD Sector Imager 6000 reader. Read Buffer is a Tris-based buffer containing tripropylamine (TPA) as a co-reactant for light generation in electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. The graph in FIG. 10 demonstrated that a dose response was observed as the concentration of the chimeric anti-pembrolizumab IgE increased. It suggests that the chimeric anti-pembrolizumab can serve as a positive control for the anti-drug antibody assay.\n",

Such anti-drug antibodies (ADA) may reduce the effectiveness of the therapeutic protein; for example, they may bind to or/and neutralize the therapeutic protein, resulting in changes of drug pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics that alters drug efficacy. ADA may cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions, cross-reactivity against endogenous proteins, and complement activation. A life-threatening deficiency syndrome can result if ADA cross-reacts with and neutralizes a critical endogenous protein.

The cross-blocking antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof discussed herein can be identified based on their ability to block any of the antibodies or fragments specifically set forth herein (e.g., A30514, A30523 or A30633), from binding to pembrolizumab in binding assays (e.g., bio-layer interferometry (BLI; for example FORTEBIO OCTET binding assay; Pall ForteBio Corp; Menlo Park, Calif.), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), BIACore, ELISA, flow cytometry). For example, in an embodiment of the invention, when using BLI, the tip of a fiber-optic probe is coated with ligand (e.g., pembrolizumab) and acts as the biosensor wherein binding of anti-pembrolizumab antibody or antigen-binding fragment to the pembrolizumab alters the interference pattern of white light reflected from the probe layer bound to pembrolizumab and an internal reference layer. The shift is indicative of pembrolizumab/anti-pembrolizumab binding. In an embodiment of the invention, the pembrolizumab coated tip is immersed in a solution of analyte containing antibody or antigen-binding fragment, e.g., in the well of either a 96- or 384-well plate. In an embodiment of the invention, the plate is shaken during reading to create orbital flow. To read the assay, white light is directed down the length of the fiber. As mentioned above, interference between light reflecting off the reference layer and immobilized surfaces containing pembrolizumab of the tip creates a distinctive pattern of light returning up the fiber. As molecules bind to the immobilized sensor surface, that pattern changes in proportion to the extent of binding. For example, assays can be used in which pembrolizumab is immobilized on a BLI probe or plate, a reference anti-pembrolizumab antibody or fragment binds to pembrolizumab (e.g., at saturating concentration) and a test anti-pembrolizumab antibody or fragment is added. The ability of the test antibody to compete with the reference antibody for pembrolizumab binding is then determined. In the BLI format, light interference of the pembrolizumab complex is monitored to determine if the test antibody effectively competes with the reference antibody, e.g., nanometers of light wavelength shift over time is monitored wherein a shift indicates additional binding of the test antibody and a lack of cross-blocking. In an embodiment of the invention, in the BLI format, cross-blocking is qualitatively deemed to have occurred between the antibodies if no additional binding of test antibody is observed. In an embodiment of the invention, as a control, cross-blocking of the reference antibody with itself is confirmed; wherein the assay is determined to be operating correctly if the reference antibody can cross-block itself from pembrolizumab binding. The ability of a test antibody to inhibit the binding of, for example, A30633, to pembrolizumab demonstrates that the test antibody can cross-block A30633 for binding to pembrolizumab and thus, may, in some cases, bind to the same epitope on pembrolizumab as A30633. As stated above, antibodies and fragments that bind to the same epitope as any of the anti-pembrolizumab antibodies or fragments of the present invention also form part of the present invention. In an embodiment of the invention, BLI is conducted in a sandwich format wherein a reference anti-pembrolizumab antibody or antigen-binding fragment is immobilized to the probe and then bound with pembrolizumab. Test anti-pembrolizumab antibody or antigen-binding fragment is then tested for the ability to block binding of the references antibody or fragment.</div>\n",

A first polynucleotide molecule is âhybridizableâ to a second polynucleotide molecule when a single stranded form of the first polynucleotide molecule can anneal to the second polynucleotide molecule under the appropriate conditions of temperature and solution ionic strength (see Sambrook, et al., supra). The conditions of temperature and ionic strength determine the âstringencyâ of the hybridization. Typical low stringency hybridization conditions include 55Â° C., 5ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS and no formamide; or 30% formamide, 5ÃSSC, 0.5% SDS at 42Â° C. Typical moderate stringency hybridization conditions are 40% formamide, with 5Ãor 6ÃSSC and 0.1% SDS at 42Â° C. High stringency hybridization conditions are 50% formamide, 5Ã or 6ÃSSC at 42Â° C. or, optionally, at a higher temperature (e.g., 57Â° C., 59Â° C., 60Â° C., 62Â° C., 63Â° C., 65Â° C. or 68Â° C.). In general, SSC is 0.15M NaCl and 0.015M Na-citrate. Hybridization requires that the two polynucleotide contain complementary sequences, although, depending on the stringency of the hybridization, mismatches between bases are possible. The appropriate stringency for hybridizing polynucleotides depends on the length of the polynucleotides and the degree of complementation, variables well known in the art. The greater the degree of similarity or homology between two nucleotide sequences, the higher the stringency under which the nucleic acids may hybridize. For hybrids of greater than 100 nucleotides in length, equations for calculating the melting temperature have been derived (see Sambrook, et al., supra, 9.50-9.51). For hybridization with shorter polynucleotides, e.g., oligonucleotides, the position of mismatches becomes more important, and the length of the oligonucleotide determines its specificity (see Sambrook, et al., supra, 11.7-11.8).</div>\n",

When making an antibody or antigen-binding fragment comprising more than one immunoglobulin chain, e.g., an antibody that comprises two heavy immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains, co-expression of the chains in a single host cell leads to association of the chains, e.g., in the cell or on the cell surface or outside the cell if such chains are secreted, so as to form the antibody or antigen-binding fragment molecule.

In an embodiment of the invention, the medium is in a column to which the sample is applied. In an embodiment of the invention, the purification method is conducted following recombinant expression of the antibody or fragment in a host cell, e.g., wherein the host cell is first lysed and, optionally, the lysate is purified of insoluble materials prior to purification on a medium; or wherein the antibody or fragment is secreted into the culture medium by the host cell and the medium or a fraction thereof is applied to the purification medium.</div>\n",

In this assay, the biotinylated pembrolizumab was used as the capture and ruthenylated anti-human IgE was used as the detector. Initially, the biotinylated pembrolizumab at 100 ng/mL was added to a MesoScale Discovery (MSD) 96 well plate coated with streptavidin, and incubated for approximately an hour. After the removal of unbound Biotinylated pembrolizumab, the chimeric anti-pembrolizumab IgE at different concentrations were added to the wells, and allowed for overnight incubation at 4Â° C. On <figure-callout id=\"2\" label=\"day\" filenames=\"US20170089914A1-20170330-D00003.png,US20170089914A1-20170330-D00004.png\" state=\"{{state}}\">day</figure-callout> 2, the wells were washed to remove the unbound samples, followed by the addition of ruthenylated anti-human IgE at 200ng/mL. After an hour of incubation, the wells were washed, and lx Read buffer was added before analyzed by MSD Sector Imager 6000 reader. Read Buffer is a Tris-based buffer containing tripropylamine (TPA) as a co-reactant for light generation in electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. The graph in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref> demonstrated that a dose response was observed as the concentration of the chimeric anti-pembrolizumab IgE increased. It suggests that the chimeric anti-pembrolizumab can serve as a positive control for the anti-drug antibody assay.</div>\n",
