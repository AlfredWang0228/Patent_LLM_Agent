# LLM-Driven Text-to-SQL Agent Frameworks

This report examines current frameworks for building **Text-to-SQL agents** powered by large language models (LLMs). We focus on open-source solutions that can plug in different LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 API, HuggingFace models, or local models via Ollama), work with SQLite for a proof-of-concept, and scale to other SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.). We also consider their ability to handle complex SQL (e.g. multi-table joins with 20+ tables). Below, we compare popular frameworks (like **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex**), discuss their pros/cons and usage, provide example implementations, highlight challenges (query optimization, correctness, etc.), and recommend a best approach with deployment advice.

## Comparison of Text-to-SQL Agent Frameworks

Several frameworks enable natural language to SQL conversion using LLMs. We compare a few leading options:

### LangChain (SQL Chains/Agents)

**LangChain** is a general LLM application framework that includes tools for database Q&A. It offers two main approaches for Text-to-SQL:

- **SQLDatabaseChain**: A chain that takes a user question, incorporates database schema info into the prompt, and asks the LLM to directly produce a SQL query and answer. For example, one can prompt an LLM to act as a SQL expert: _“...formulate a SQL query for the question, run it, and return the result as an answer”_ ([SQLDatabaseChain](https://h3manth.com/notes/SQLDatabaseChain/#:~:text=PROMPT%20%3D%20,about%20the%20data%2C%20I%20will)) ([SQLDatabaseChain](https://h3manth.com/notes/SQLDatabaseChain/#:~:text=db_chain%20%3D%20SQLDatabaseChain,top_k%3D3)). LangChain will execute the LLM-generated SQL on the database and then optionally let the LLM summarize the result (as in counting rows, etc.). This provides a straightforward pipeline: **(Question) -> LLM -> SQL -> Execute -> Answer**.

- **SQL Agent (SQLDatabaseToolkit)**: An *agent* that uses multiple tools to interact with the database. LangChain’s SQL toolkit supplies tools like `list_tables`, `get_table_info`, `query_sql`, and a `query_checker`. The LLM can iteratively decide to call these tools (via a ReAct prompting strategy) to find the schema and compose the query. It can recover from errors by analyzing SQL syntax or execution errors and refining the query. This agentic approach is more flexible – the LLM “figures out” which tables/columns are relevant by using the tools, rather than needing the entire schema in one prompt ([GitHub - arunpshankar/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures: A collection of architectural patterns leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient Text-to-SQL generation.](https://github.com/arunpshankar/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures#:~:text=Adopting%20an%20autonomous%20agent,queries%20with%20minimal%20external%20guidance)). For example, a LangChain SQL agent might first list all tables, then request the schema of the most relevant ones, then form a SELECT with JOINs, execute it, and finally present the answer.

**Pros (LangChain):**

- *Integrations*: Supports many LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace pipelines, local LlamaCPP, etc.) through a unified interface. You can easily swap in GPT-4 or a local model as the LLM driver.
- *Agent flexibility*: The SQL agent can do step-by-step reasoning. It can attempt a query, see an error, and adjust the query (either automatically or with a human-in-the-loop if desired). This iterative refinement is powerful for complex queries ([GitHub - arunpshankar/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures: A collection of architectural patterns leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient Text-to-SQL generation.](https://github.com/arunpshankar/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures#:~:text=Adopting%20an%20autonomous%20agent,queries%20with%20minimal%20external%20guidance)) and error recovery.
- *Ease of use*: High-level classes like `SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm()` make it quick to build a basic Q&A system. The framework handles connecting to the DB (via SQLAlchemy) and running queries.
- *Extensibility*: LangChain’s modular design lets you add custom prompts, or even use a **LangChain Graph** execution where writing the SQL, executing it, and generating the answer are separate steps in a sequence ([Build a Question/Answering system over SQL data | ️ LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/#:~:text=print)) ([Build a Question/Answering system over SQL data | ️ LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/#:~:text=,answer%27%3A%20%27There%20are%208%20employees)) (allowing fine control, debugging, or inserting approval steps).

**Cons (LangChain):**

- *Prompt tuning needed for local models*: LangChain’s default prompts and agent logic were optimized for ChatGPT/GPT-4 style LLMs. Users have reported that smaller open-source models can struggle with the expected format. For example, one user found a local Llama-2 model failed to properly use the `sql_db_schema` tool due to prompt format issues ([Using SQLDatabaseToolkit and LlamaCpp to Query a Local Database with a Local LLM : r/LangChain](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/187wah9/using_sqldatabasetoolkit_and_llamacpp_to_query_a/#:~:text=I%20should%20look%20at%20the,not%20found%20in%20database)) ([Using SQLDatabaseToolkit and LlamaCpp to Query a Local Database with a Local LLM : r/LangChain](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/187wah9/using_sqldatabasetoolkit_and_llamacpp_to_query_a/#:~:text=You%20have%20a%20few%20issues,here)). Adjusting the prompts or using a more capable model was necessary. In short, LangChain works best with powerful models; weaker models might require prompt/template customization ([Using SQLDatabaseToolkit and LlamaCpp to Query a Local Database with a Local LLM : r/LangChain](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/187wah9/using_sqldatabasetoolkit_and_llamacpp_to_query_a/#:~:text=You%20have%20a%20few%20issues,here)).
- *Context limits*: By default, the SQL agent may supply the LLM with the entire schema or large parts of it, especially if many tables are involved. For a very large database (dozens of tables with many columns), this can hit context length limits or incur high token costs. (One anecdote noted that an agent consumed ~$10 of API calls on a single complex query against ~1500 tables due to sending a lot of schema text.) You may need to limit schema details or use a retrieval approach to feed only relevant schema info.
- *Reliability*: The chain/agent’s success depends on the LLM’s correctness. The LLM might still produce an incorrect or suboptimal SQL query that runs without error but yields wrong results. LangChain’s `QueryCheckerTool` uses an LLM to double-check the SQL text, but it isn’t foolproof ([Using SQLDatabaseToolkit and LlamaCpp to Query a Local Database with a Local LLM : r/LangChain](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/187wah9/using_sqldatabasetoolkit_and_llamacpp_to_query_a/#:~:text=You%20have%20a%20few%20issues,here)). Thus, careful testing and perhaps additional verification of results are needed.
- *Security concerns*: Because LangChain will execute whatever SQL the LLM generates, there is a risk if the prompt or model is not well controlled. The LangChain docs explicitly warn to **restrict the database user permissions** (e.g. use read-only credentials, no DROP/DELETE privileges) when using LLM-generated SQL ([SQLDatabase Toolkit | ️ LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/sql_database/#:~:text=%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F%20Security%20note%20%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F)).

**Use cases**: LangChain is suitable if you need an *interactive agent* that can handle multi-step reasoning on the database. For example, if the query might require checking multiple tables or if you want the system to clarify ambiguities with follow-up questions, LangChain’s agent approach is useful. It’s also a good choice if you plan to integrate the solution into a larger LLM workflow (LangChain can combine the SQL agent with other tools or memory modules in a broader application). For simpler single-shot query generation, the direct chain approach may suffice.

### LlamaIndex (GPT Index) 

**LlamaIndex** (formerly GPT Index) is a framework focused on connecting LLMs with external data, including structured data like SQL databases. It provides a **Natural Language SQL Query Engine** that can translate a question into SQL, execute it, and return results. The key component is the `NLSQLTableQueryEngine` (natural-language SQL engine), built on a `SQLDatabase` abstraction.

**How it works:** You first connect the database to LlamaIndex (e.g. create a `SQLDatabase` from a SQLAlchemy engine). LlamaIndex can introspect the schema. The `NLSQLTableQueryEngine` then uses the schema to interpret questions. Internally, it employs a pipeline: it uses an LLM to parse the natural language question and *synthesize a SQL query*, runs that query on the database, and then can feed the results back into the LLM for formulating a final answer ([Creating a Natural Language to SQL System using Llama Index | by Plaban Nayak | AI Planet](https://medium.aiplanet.com/creating-a-natural-language-to-sql-system-using-llama-index-10373e665bbb#:~:text=Once%20we%20have%20constructed%20our,are%20synthesized%20into%20SQL%20queries)) ([Creating a Natural Language to SQL System using Llama Index | by Plaban Nayak | AI Planet](https://medium.aiplanet.com/creating-a-natural-language-to-sql-system-using-llama-index-10373e665bbb#:~:text=,the%20top%2010%20bad%20ReviewBody)). LlamaIndex can wrap this logic as a **tool** in an agent, or run it directly. For example, you can create a `QueryEngineTool` that calls the SQL engine, and then use an `OpenAIAgent` to manage a conversation that calls this tool when needed ([Creating a Natural Language to SQL System using Llama Index | by Plaban Nayak | AI Planet](https://medium.aiplanet.com/creating-a-natural-language-to-sql-system-using-llama-index-10373e665bbb#:~:text=A%20query%20engine%20wraps%20a,LLM%20to%20generate%20a%20response)) ([Creating a Natural Language to SQL System using Llama Index | by Plaban Nayak | AI Planet](https://medium.aiplanet.com/creating-a-natural-language-to-sql-system-using-llama-index-10373e665bbb#:~:text=,Another)). In a simple Q&A scenario, you might not need an external agent loop – you can directly call `query_engine.query("...")` and get an answer.

LlamaIndex also supports *retriever-augmented generation* for structured data. This means instead of always providing the full schema or data to the LLM, it can use embeddings to find which tables or rows are relevant. For instance, the newer `SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine` can embed table schema and even content, retrieve the most relevant pieces for a query, and let the LLM use only those ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=2)) ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=Wren%20AI%20consists%20of%20three,core%20services)). This is helpful when dealing with many tables or very large tables – it narrows the context given to the LLM, reducing token usage and focusing the generation.

**Pros (LlamaIndex):**

- *Structured data specialization*: LlamaIndex’s SQL query engine is designed specifically for text-to-SQL, with a built-in pipeline. It can accurately map natural language conditions to SQL. In the example from LlamaIndex documentation, the agent was able to generate a correct SQL JOIN or aggregation and immediately execute it ([Creating a Natural Language to SQL System using Llama Index | by Plaban Nayak | AI Planet](https://medium.aiplanet.com/creating-a-natural-language-to-sql-system-using-llama-index-10373e665bbb#:~:text=%3D%3D%3D%20Calling%20Function%20%3D%3D%3D%20Calling,)) ([Creating a Natural Language to SQL System using Llama Index | by Plaban Nayak | AI Planet](https://medium.aiplanet.com/creating-a-natural-language-to-sql-system-using-llama-index-10373e665bbb#:~:text=agent%20%3D%20OpenAIAgent.from_tools%28tools%3D%5Bsql_tool%5D%2Cverbose%3DTrue%29%20,overall%20ratings%20greater%20than%203)). The framework can also summarize or interpret query results automatically. For instance, if the query returns many rows (e.g., text reviews), the engine can have the LLM summarize them rather than returning raw data ([Creating a Natural Language to SQL System using Llama Index | by Plaban Nayak | AI Planet](https://medium.aiplanet.com/creating-a-natural-language-to-sql-system-using-llama-index-10373e665bbb#:~:text=Calling%20function%3A%20sql_query%20with%20args%3A,had%20a%20terrible%20experience%20with)).
- *Retrieval augmentation*: LlamaIndex can integrate vector search to handle large schemas. It can treat schema metadata or even sample data as a knowledge base – the LLM first *retrieves relevant schema components* (tables/columns) based on the question, then only generates SQL using those. This RAG approach mitigates the context limit problem and improves accuracy by focusing on relevant tables. The Wren AI project (discussed later) uses a similar idea of not exposing the entire schema to the LLM at once ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=2)).
- *Multi-modal queries*: The advanced `SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine` even allows *joining unstructured data with structured data* in one query ([Combining Text-to-SQL with Semantic Search for Retrieval Augmented Generation — LlamaIndex - Build Knowledge Assistants over your Enterprise Data](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/combining-text-to-sql-with-semantic-search-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-c60af30ec3b#:~:text=match%20at%20L175%20We%20have,to%20synthesize%20the%20final%20answer)) ([Combining Text-to-SQL with Semantic Search for Retrieval Augmented Generation — LlamaIndex - Build Knowledge Assistants over your Enterprise Data](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/combining-text-to-sql-with-semantic-search-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-c60af30ec3b#:~:text=match%20at%20L296%20Finally%2C%20we,SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine)). While not needed for pure SQL use-cases, this showcases the flexibility of LlamaIndex to combine SQL results with text embeddings (for example, “Find the city with highest population from SQL, then retrieve a document about that city from a vector store, and combine the info”). This could be useful if part of the question involves free-text that isn’t in the database.
- *LLM flexibility*: Like LangChain, LlamaIndex supports various LLMs via its `LLMPredictor` interface. You can use OpenAI models or local HuggingFace models (including through Ollama) by configuring the LLM predictor. It’s possible to integrate GPT-4 for best accuracy, or use an open model for privacy reasons.
- *Simplicity of usage*: For single-shot questions, using the NLSQL engine can feel straightforward – you ask a question and get an answer without manually orchestrating multiple steps. Under the hood it’s doing the heavy lifting, but you don’t necessarily have to manage each tool step yourself.

**Cons (LlamaIndex):**

- *Less agent control out-of-the-box*: While LlamaIndex can be used within an agent loop, its primary abstraction (QueryEngine) hides the step-by-step process. This is great for simplicity, but if something goes wrong (e.g., the LLM misunderstands the schema), it may be a bit harder to debug the chain of thought compared to LangChain’s verbose agent where you see each tool step. (That said, LlamaIndex does provide logs and one could inspect the intermediate SQL it generated.)
- *Documentation and community*: LangChain has a very large community and extensive examples of SQL agents. LlamaIndex is growing fast, but its examples for text-to-SQL are slightly fewer. Developers might need to refer to community forums for complex scenarios (for instance, how to handle *multiple tables* in a query – the engine does support multi-table joins, but ensuring the LLM picks the correct foreign key relationships might require providing good schema descriptions).
- *Open-source model performance*: Just like with LangChain, using an open-source LLM with LlamaIndex for SQL may require a strong model. Smaller models (7B-13B parameters) could struggle with complex joins or aggregations unless finely tuned. LlamaIndex doesn’t natively provide a fine-tuned Text-to-SQL model – it relies on the general LLM’s capabilities, so using GPT-4 or a similarly powerful model is recommended for the hardest queries.
- *Execution limits*: The framework will execute any SQL the LLM produces. If the question is ambiguous or the LLM over-generalizes, it might run a heavy query (e.g., a `SELECT *` on a huge table) which could be slow. There isn’t a built-in query optimizer beyond what the database itself does. So, long-running queries or large results might need to be handled (perhaps by adding limits or summarization in the prompt, or using the approach of multiple attempts with timeout – not default in LlamaIndex).

**Use cases**: LlamaIndex is a strong choice if you want a *ready-made NL->SQL translator* with minimal configuration. It’s well-suited for a question-answering setting where the user asks in natural language and you want the single best answer. It shines when you have moderate schema complexity and want to leverage retrieval (for example, a database with 20 tables – LlamaIndex can embed the schema and quickly find which tables are mentioned by the question). If you foresee integrating unstructured data or doing more on the data (like follow-up natural language analysis of results), LlamaIndex’s approach is very handy.

### Wren AI (Open-Source GenBI Agent)

**Wren AI** is an open-source *Generative Business Intelligence* platform that specifically targets Text-to-SQL as an end-to-end solution. It’s essentially a pre-built agent that you can deploy for your own databases. Under the hood, Wren AI uses a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture** to make LLMs generate SQL accurately and securely ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=2)). 

Key features of Wren AI include:

- **Schema Parsing and Vector Store**: Wren AI will ingest your database schema (and possibly example data or metadata) into a vector database. When a question is asked, it retrieves the relevant schema context (table names, column info, etc.) and provides that to the LLM, instead of sending the entire schema. This helps the LLM focus and also means your actual data *rows* aren’t exposed to the LLM (only the schema and aggregated info are) ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=2)).
- **LLM Integration**: It’s designed to work with multiple LLMs. It supports OpenAI API models as well as local ones via Ollama, and others (Anthropic, Vertex AI, etc.) ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=Wren%20AI%20supports%20integration%20with,including%20but%20not%20limited%20to)). This matches the requirement of plugging in GPT-4 or an open-source model.
- **Agentic Workflow**: Wren AI’s agent will attempt a SQL query, get the results, and then *give you both the SQL and an answer/insight*. It even provides features like suggested follow-up questions and the ability to generate charts or reports from the result ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=1,in%20Any%20Language)) ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=2)). In that sense, it’s more than just getting the SQL – it’s a full BI assistant (e.g., it might answer: “There are 5,234 users who joined in 2023” and show the SQL it ran).
- **User Interface**: Unlike LangChain or LlamaIndex (which are libraries you incorporate into your app), Wren AI comes with a UI and can be run as a local web app or used via API. This can accelerate deployment if you want a quick demo for non-technical users to “chat with the database”.

**Pros (Wren AI):**

- *Turnkey solution*: It is a “batteries-included” system ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=1)). You don’t have to assemble an agent from scratch; Wren provides configuration to connect to your DB, and then you can immediately ask questions through the UI or API. This saves development time.
- *Schema-level RAG*: By using a retrieval step to provide schema context to the LLM, it avoids the token overload problem and also adds a layer of safety (the LLM is less likely to hallucinate table or column names that don’t exist, because it only sees actual schema entries that were retrieved). The Wren AI team emphasizes that they **do not send your raw data to the LLM**, only the schema and relevant info, which addresses some privacy concerns ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=2)).
- *Multi-LLM support*: If you want to experiment with different models, Wren’s integration makes it easy to switch. For example, you could test GPT-4 vs Llama2 70B via Ollama by just changing config. This flexibility is built-in ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=Wren%20AI%20supports%20integration%20with,including%20but%20not%20limited%20to)).
- *Advanced features*: Wren AI goes beyond just SQL generation. It can generate charts, spreadsheets, and narrative reports from the query results ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=1,in%20Any%20Language)) ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=,faster%2C%20smarter%20decisions%20with%20ease)). This is useful for BI use-cases where the end goal is an insight or visualization, not just the raw SQL answer.
- *Open-source and extensible*: You can self-host Wren AI and integrate it into your stack. Because it’s open-source, you can potentially customize the agent’s prompts or add plugins. It’s designed for enterprise data scenarios, so it’s built with scaling and security in mind (for example, you can define relationships and semantic mappings in a “Wren Engine” to help the agent understand business terms) ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=,to%20produce%20precise%20SQL%20outputs)).

**Cons (Wren AI):**

- *Complexity*: As a full end-to-end platform, it might be overkill for a simple POC. It requires setting up its services (UI, service, engine) ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=Wren%20AI%20consists%20of%20three,core%20services)). If you just want a quick script that translates English to SQL, Wren’s multi-component architecture could be more than you need. It’s geared toward a more **production BI environment**.
- *Learning curve*: Operating Wren AI involves understanding its configuration (e.g., connecting the vector DB, setting up the engine with business definitions, etc.). This is easier than building everything from scratch, but it’s more involved than using a single library function from LangChain/LlamaIndex. The documentation should be followed for setup.
- *Less lightweight*: Because it bundles a UI and other features, Wren AI may use more resources. If you just need a backend service without a UI, you might instead directly use LlamaIndex or LangChain in a minimal API app. Wren is optimal when you actually want that user-facing “chat with data” interface out-of-the-box.
- *Community maturity*: Wren AI is a newer project (as of 2023) compared to LangChain/LlamaIndex. While it’s open-source, its user base is smaller, meaning community support or finding examples might be a bit harder (outside of the official docs). However, its focus is narrow (BI with text-to-SQL), which means it’s likely quite optimized for that use-case.

**Use cases**: Wren AI is recommended when you want a **ready-to-deploy BI assistant**. If your goal is to allow analysts or non-technical users to ask data questions in natural language and get answers (with SQL under the hood), Wren provides the full stack for that. It’s particularly useful for complex schemas because of the RAG approach, and if you plan to use it in an organization (where a UI and authentication, etc., might be needed). It supports multiple databases (the GitHub mentions BigQuery, PostgreSQL, etc.) so it can be used beyond just SQLite.

### Other Approaches and Frameworks

Aside from the above, a few other notable solutions or patterns for LLM-driven text-to-SQL:

- **OpenAI Function Calling or Plugins**: Without a third-party framework, one can use ChatGPT’s function calling ability to create a mini-agent that converts NL to SQL. For example, you define a function `execute_sql(query: string)` and provide the database schema in the prompt; GPT-4 can then output a function call with the SQL, which your code executes, and then GPT-4 can answer with the results. This is essentially what the official ChatGPT SQL plugins do. It can work for a custom app, but you’d be reinventing some of what LangChain/LlamaIndex offer (tool usage logic, error handling, etc.). It’s an option if you want fine-grained control without additional dependencies – but note it ties you to OpenAI’s ecosystem and still requires careful prompt engineering.
- **Fine-tuned NL2SQL Models**: There are open-source LLMs fine-tuned on text-to-SQL datasets (like the **Spider** dataset). Examples include the PICARD method on T5, or various academic models (RAT-SQL + T5, etc.). These can be used via Hugging Face transformers. Fine-tuned models can produce very accurate SQL for complex schemas without needing an agent, *but* they often require the schema to be provided as input and have fixed architectures. Since the question asks to avoid building from scratch, training a custom model would be out of scope. However, one could leverage an existing fine-tuned 7B or 13B model if available. The downside is they might not be as flexible (they were trained on specific schema patterns) and integrating them with actual database execution still requires glue code. In practice, using a general LLM with a framework (as above) has become more popular due to the flexibility and not having to maintain a separate model.
- **Other Tools**: There are emerging libraries like **ToolLLM** or **Haystack** that can also do text-to-SQL with LLMs, but they are less established. Some projects like “GPT4All-Data” or “DB-GPT” have attempted to offer local GPT-based database querying. These often internally use LangChain or similar under the hood, providing a wrapper for ease of use. For example, an open project *“LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures”* on GitHub demonstrates patterns like direct LLM with self-correction and multi-agent collaboration for SQL ([GitHub - arunpshankar/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures: A collection of architectural patterns leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient Text-to-SQL generation.](https://github.com/arunpshankar/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures#:~:text=Challenges%20and%20Limitations%20%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F)), though it’s more a collection of ideas than a plug-in library. Generally, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Wren AI cover the range from DIY toolkit to full solution.

The table below summarizes the compared frameworks:

## Pros, Cons, and Applicability of Each Framework

**LangChain:** Great for step-by-step agent behavior and integration into custom workflows. If your queries may involve reasoning or multiple steps (e.g., “first find the X, then use that to query Y”) or you want a conversational agent that can ask for clarification, LangChain is ideal. Its main drawbacks are the overhead of large prompts for big schemas and some fiddling required for non-OpenAI models. Ensure to use it with a sufficiently capable LLM (GPT-4 or a fine-tuned 30B+ model for complex tasks).

**LlamaIndex:** Ideal when you want an *out-of-the-box NL to SQL translator* that you can call like a function. It’s efficient in handling schema via retrieval, which suits complex databases (20+ tables). This might be more appropriate than LangChain if you don’t need the agent to do other things – basically if the task is strictly “question -> answer from database”, LlamaIndex’s focused engine can be more straightforward. A potential limitation is that in a dynamic conversation, you might have to manage follow-up questions context (LangChain might handle multi-turn dialogue more naturally with memory, whereas with LlamaIndex you might need to carry over conversation state manually if needed).

**Wren AI:** Most applicable in a **production BI scenario** where multiple users will ask a variety of questions on a large database, and you want a robust, secure deployment. It shines for multi-table schemas and where you want to avoid any chance of the LLM doing something outside its scope (since it constrains queries to the schema it knows). If you are just coding a quick demo or integrating into an existing app, Wren might be heavier than needed; but if you actually want to deploy a tool internally for analysts, it’s likely the fastest route to a full-featured solution (with relatively little coding).

## Example Implementation Approaches

Below are simplified example implementations for LangChain and LlamaIndex using SQLite (which can be swapped out for other SQL databases). These illustrate how one might set up a Text-to-SQL agent or chain:

**Using LangChain (SQLDatabaseChain):**

```python
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain
from langchain.sql_database import SQLDatabase

# 1. Connect to the database (SQLite in-memory example)
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")  # Chinook is a sample music DB

# 2. Initialize an LLM (using OpenAI GPT-4 in this case)
llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0)  # or another model

# 3. Set up the chain for natural language Q&A over the SQL database
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)

# 4. Ask a question in natural language
question = "Which customer spent the most on invoices, and how much did they spend?"
result = db_chain.run(question)

print(result)
# The chain will print the SQL it constructs and the final answer, e.g.:
# SQL: SELECT CustomerId, SUM(Invoice.Total) AS TotalSpent FROM Invoice GROUP BY CustomerId ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC LIMIT 1;
# Answer: "Customer 57 spent the most, with a total of $158.62."
```

In this example, `SQLDatabaseChain` takes care of prompting GPT-4 with the Chinook schema and the question. The LLM generates a SQL query (as shown in the verbose log), the chain executes it, then the LLM provides the answer based on the result. For more complex scenarios, one could use `SQLDatabaseToolkit` and an agent, where the LLM might do `agent.run("...")` and internally use tools to get table info etc. But for many use cases, the simple chain is sufficient.

**Using LlamaIndex (NLSQLTableQueryEngine):**

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from llama_index import SQLDatabase, ServiceContext, LLMPredictor, GPTVectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.indices.struct_store import NLSQLTableQueryEngine
from llama_index.llms import OpenAI

# 1. Create SQLAlchemy engine for your SQLite database
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Chinook.db")
sql_database = SQLDatabase(engine)

# 2. Initialize LLM predictor (using OpenAI GPT-3.5 in this example)
llm_predictor = LLMPredictor(llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0))
service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm_predictor=llm_predictor)

# 3. Instantiate the natural language SQL query engine
nl_sql_engine = NLSQLTableQueryEngine(sql_database=sql_database, service_context=service_context)

# 4. Ask a question in natural language
query = "Which customer spent the most on invoices, and how much did they spend?"
response = nl_sql_engine.query(query)

print(response)
# The response object contains the answer; you can print it out or get a formatted result.
# It might output: "Customer 57 spent the most, with a total of 158.62 USD."
```

Here, LlamaIndex’s engine will internally figure out it needs the `Invoice` and `Customer` tables, generate the appropriate SQL, execute it via the SQLAlchemy engine, and then return an answer. We used GPT-3.5 for cost-efficiency in this example; for more complex queries involving 20+ table joins, GPT-4 or a stronger model would likely perform better in generating correct SQL. 

*Note:* In practice, you might want the raw SQL or the result rows as well. Both LangChain and LlamaIndex allow you to retrieve the SQL string if needed. For instance, LangChain’s chain result can be a tuple of (sql, answer) if configured, and LlamaIndex’s `NLSQLTableQueryEngine` could be adapted to return the SQL it ran (by examining the logs). This can be useful for auditing or optimizing the queries later.

**Using Wren AI:** Wren AI is typically run as a separate service, so an example usage would be more about configuration than code. For instance, you would:

- Connect Wren to your database (provide connection string in config).
- Run Wren’s server (which sets up the UI and API).
- Interact via the UI by asking questions in natural language, or via REST API calls to get answers programmatically.

Because Wren handles the internals, you don’t directly write Python code to generate SQL. However, behind the scenes, if you asked the same question about the highest spending customer, Wren AI’s agent would retrieve the schema for the `Invoice` and `Customer` tables from its vector store, feed them to the LLM, generate the SQL, execute it, and reply with the result (and possibly show a bar chart or offer a follow-up like “Do you want to see the list of top 5 customers?”).

## Potential Challenges and Considerations

Implementing an LLM-driven Text-to-SQL system comes with several challenges:

- **SQL Correctness and Accuracy**: LLMs, even GPT-4, can sometimes generate incorrect SQL. They might use a wrong table or join key if the schema is complex or if there are slight ambiguities in the schema naming. Ensuring correctness is hard without verification. One strategy is to execute the query and check if the result makes sense (but for logical errors that still produce results, this is tough). Another strategy is to prompt the LLM to *explain its SQL* step-by-step or double-check it. Frameworks like LangChain include a `QueryCheckerTool` which uses the LLM to review the SQL before execution ([Using SQLDatabaseToolkit and LlamaCpp to Query a Local Database with a Local LLM : r/LangChain](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/187wah9/using_sqldatabasetoolkit_and_llamacpp_to_query_a/#:~:text=You%20have%20a%20few%20issues,here)), catching some mistakes (like syntax issues or missing conditions). However, logical accuracy remains a concern. Human oversight is advised for critical use-cases, at least during initial development and testing.

- **Complex Query Handling**: For multi-table joins (e.g., 5-20 tables), the search space of possible SQL queries is huge. An LLM might not reliably navigate such complexity in one shot. It may omit necessary join conditions (leading to a cartesian product) or mis-order the query. Techniques to mitigate this include breaking the problem down (decomposition). For example, an agent could answer a complex query by doing several simpler queries and combining results, but this requires careful prompt engineering. Some research works propose having the LLM plan sub-queries (decomposition) or do a self-refinement loop where it checks if the current query truly answers the question and, if not, adjusts it ([GitHub - arunpshankar/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures: A collection of architectural patterns leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient Text-to-SQL generation.](https://github.com/arunpshankar/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures#:~:text=feedback%20to%20self,reduce%20costs%20and%20improve%20latency)). Current frameworks don’t fully implement multi-step decomposition of SQL logic (they attempt one big query), so extremely complex questions might need custom handling. 

- **Context and Schema Scale**: As noted, large schemas are problematic. If you have 50 tables and the user asks a broad question, providing all table schemas to the LLM might exceed token limits. RAG approaches help: by embedding table schemas and using similarity search, you feed only the top-k relevant tables to the prompt. This requires an upfront indexing of the schema (which LlamaIndex and Wren AI do). Another approach is to let the agent ask which tables are relevant (LangChain’s agent effectively does this by calling `list_tables` and then picking some for `sql_db_schema`). But if the LLM wrongly guesses relevant tables, it could miss the answer. Careful prompt design (including all likely keywords) or fallback strategies (if the first attempt yields no result, try including more tables) can improve success.

- **Query Optimization and Performance**: An LLM will write a correct SQL query, but it may not be the most efficient query. It doesn’t have a query planner’s insight. For instance, it might join many tables when a subquery or different approach would be faster, or not add an index hint where one is needed. For a POC on small data this isn’t a big issue, but in production, slow queries could impact the database. A possible mitigation is to have a time-out on query execution or to analyze the LLM-generated SQL with a database EXPLAIN to see if it’s doing something crazy. Some advanced patterns (as mentioned in the architectural patterns repo) even considered running multiple candidate SQL queries and choosing the fastest ([GitHub - arunpshankar/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures: A collection of architectural patterns leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient Text-to-SQL generation.](https://github.com/arunpshankar/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures#:~:text=Pattern%20V%3A%20Direct%20Schema%20Inference%2C,Correction%20%26%20Optimization)), but that’s experimental. In practice, you might enforce limits like “don’t SELECT more than 1000 rows” or always include a date filter if querying a huge fact table, via the prompt or application logic.

- **LLM Hallucination and Schema Errors**: Despite having the schema, LLMs might hallucinate column names or functions (e.g., it might try to use a column that exists in a similar table but not in the one it chose). This often leads to SQL execution errors. The agent should ideally handle this by catching the error and either asking the LLM to fix it or by providing the error message back for analysis. LangChain’s agent will feed the SQL error back into the LLM’s context so it can attempt a correction, which usually works if it’s a minor mistake. This loop might repeat a few times (costing extra tokens). It’s important to set the LLM’s **temperature to 0 (deterministic)** for these scenarios to ensure consistency during retries. In testing, one should observe how many retries typically happen and perhaps adjust the approach if it’s too many.

- **Natural Language Ambiguity**: Users might ask questions that are ambiguous or not fully specified for a database query. For example, “How many users joined last year?” – does “joined” mean sign-up? And which year exactly is “last year”? A robust system should handle this either by making assumptions or asking a clarifying question. GPT-4 is quite good at disambiguation, but whether it asks for clarification depends on the prompting. In a one-shot scenario, it might guess. In a conversational agent, you can prompt it to ask the user if something is unclear. Balancing this is tricky: too many clarifications make the agent seem incompetent, too few and it risks a wrong query. This is more of a design challenge than a technical one, but frameworks give you the ability to insert a step for clarification if needed (e.g., LangChain could detect a low confidence and then return a question to the user instead of SQL).

- **Security and Safety**: We touched on DB security (use read-only users, etc.). Another angle is preventing the system from answering questions it shouldn’t. If the database contains sensitive info, an unrestricted agent might reveal it if asked. Traditional SQL permission can handle *which data* can be accessed, but an agent might also produce answers that violate policies (e.g., combining data in a way that breaks privacy rules). Ensuring compliance might involve adding a final LLM step to filter the answer (“Check that this answer does not contain personal data”) or building in role-based rules on what queries are allowed. These are considerations when moving to production deployment, especially with sensitive databases.

- **Testing and Evaluation**: It can be hard to evaluate an NL2SQL system because it’s not just about getting SQL correct, but getting the *right answer* to the user’s question. During development, it’s wise to have a set of example questions with expected answers (ground truth) to systematically test the agent. This could be as formal as unit tests that compare the agent’s answer to a known correct answer (for a given seed database). It helps catch cases where the SQL executes but yields a wrong result set (which the LLM will happily format into an answer). Evaluation datasets like Spider or others could be repurposed to validate the agent’s capability on complex queries.

In summary, building an LLM-driven SQL agent requires careful handling of the above challenges. The good news is that frameworks are evolving to address many of them (for instance, better retrieval to handle schema scale, and using function calling to constrain outputs). Nonetheless, a human developer should remain “in the loop” especially early on to review the generated SQL and results for correctness and efficiency.

## Recommended Solution and Deployment Advice

**Best Approach:** For the requirements given, the recommended solution is to use a **retrieval-augmented Text-to-SQL agent** – in practice, this could be achieved by **Wren AI** or by combining **LlamaIndex’s** capabilities with a LangChain-style agent. This approach will handle a complex schema in a scalable way and allow switching between GPT-4 or open models.

If you prefer a **ready-made framework**, **Wren AI is an excellent choice** because it was built exactly for this purpose: it uses RAG to feed the schema to the LLM so that even with 20+ tables, it only exposes what’s needed ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=2)). It’s compatible with OpenAI and Ollama (for local models) out-of-the-box ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=Wren%20AI%20supports%20integration%20with,including%20but%20not%20limited%20to)), fulfilling the compatibility requirement. Wren AI will let you start with SQLite (connect to the file or memory DB) and later point to Postgres by just changing the config. It also adds nice features like a UI and chart generation which can be bonuses for a POC (stakeholders can visualize results). 

To deploy Wren AI in practice, you would do the following:

- Ensure you have access to an LLM (API key for OpenAI, or a local model set up with Ollama). For complex queries, GPT-4 or a similarly advanced model is recommended for the highest accuracy.
- Follow Wren’s installation guide (they provide a Docker setup and a Python package). Launch the Wren AI service and UI locally.
- In the Wren config, add your database connection string. For SQLite, it could be a file path or memory DB; for Postgres, the typical URI with credentials.
- Wren will ingest the schema. You might want to provide friendly descriptions for tables/columns (Wren allows adding semantic aliases or business terms).
- Start asking questions in the UI, verify the results. Once satisfied, you can deploy the Wren service on a server (ensuring network access to the database) and let users access it via a web interface or integrate with an existing app via API calls.

If you prefer a **more code-driven approach (no external UI)**, you could implement a similar pattern using **LlamaIndex + LangChain**:

- Use LlamaIndex to build a vector store of your schema: embed each table name and column name with some description.
- When a query comes in, use semantic search to find which tables/columns are likely relevant.
- Construct a context (like a system prompt) listing only those tables and their schema details.
- Use a LangChain SQLDatabaseChain or agent with that restricted schema. Essentially, you’d be dynamically trimming the database schema fed to the LLM.
- This hybrid approach might require more development effort, but it can optimize token usage and improve accuracy on large schemas. It’s basically a custom build of what Wren provides. The advantage is that you can deeply customize it and integrate into your own application’s interface directly.

**Why not just LangChain or LlamaIndex alone?** – You certainly *could* start with LangChain’s `SQLDatabaseChain` for a quick prototype. In fact, for a SQLite POC with a not-huge schema (say a dozen tables), LangChain with GPT-4 will work reasonably well with minimal setup. The problem arises as complexity grows: GPT-4 will try its best but might start to falter or become costly when dealing with 20+ tables at once. Similarly, LlamaIndex alone (without additional retrieval filtering) might dump a very large schema into the prompt. So the key is **augmenting either framework with retrieval** or using one that already does (like Wren). Therefore, the “best” solution is one that combines their strengths: LangChain’s agent tooling + LlamaIndex’s retrieval = a robust agent for complex databases.

**Deployment considerations:**

- **Scaling the LLM**: For production, you might use GPT-4 initially, but costs can add up. Evaluate open-source models like Llama 2 70B or Falcon-40B instruct for on-premise use via Ollama or similar. Wren AI’s caution is that the LLM largely determines the performance ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=Caution)). So if using an open model, consider one fine-tuned for instructions and code. You might even ensemble models (e.g., use GPT-4 for query generation, but a cheaper model for result summarization).
- **Database connection**: Use a read replica or a read-only user. This prevents any accidental writes and isolates the load. The agent could potentially generate heavy read queries, so it’s wise not to point it at a production primary database. SQLite in POC is fine, but for MySQL/Postgres, ensure the app has credentials with minimal privileges.
- **Monitoring and logging**: Enable verbose logging or tracing (LangChain has LangSmith, etc.) to record each query generation. This is invaluable for debugging when the agent makes a mistake. In deployment, you might log each NL question, the generated SQL, and whether it was successful. This allows you to build a feedback loop (if you notice the agent often struggles with a certain type of question, you can improve the prompt or add a few-shot example for that case).
- **Iteration**: Deploying an NL-to-SQL agent is not a one-and-done task. User questions can be unpredictable. Plan to iterate on your prompts and logic. For instance, you may add more prompt hints like *“If the question seems to ask for X, make sure to join table Y”* based on real queries seen. Both LangChain and LlamaIndex allow adjusting prompts easily.
- **User Experience**: If deploying to end-users, manage their expectations. It’s good to show the SQL or at least confidence scores. Wren AI’s approach of showing the generated SQL and even allowing users to tweak it can increase trust. Users may also need guidance on how to phrase questions the agent can handle (especially for very complex multi-part questions – you might encourage breaking it down).
- **Future improvements**: Keep an eye on new developments. LLMs are rapidly improving in structured reasoning. OpenAI might release models with larger context windows (so feeding 50 table schemas could become feasible), or specialized models for SQL. Frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex will likely introduce more features (e.g., automated few-shot prompting based on schema size, or function-calling agents that call a DB API). Upgrading to the latest versions after testing their stability can yield immediate benefits.

In conclusion, the combination of a **strong LLM**, a **framework that provides tools or retrieval**, and careful **engineering for errors/optimization** is the key to a successful LLM-driven Text-to-SQL system. For the scenario at hand, leveraging an open-source solution like **Wren AI** offers a robust starting point ([GitHub - Canner/WrenAI:  Open-source GenBI AI Agent that empowers data-driven teams to chat with their data to generate Text-to-SQL, charts, spreadsheets, reports, and BI. ‍](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI#:~:text=2)), while frameworks like **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex** give you the building blocks to tailor the agent as needed. By starting with these, you avoid reinventing the wheel and can focus on refining the agent for your specific database and queries. With thorough testing and iteration, you can deploy a **natural language SQL assistant** that handles complex questions over SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, and beyond, empowering users to interact with relational data in a conversational way.

## 一、概述

随着大语言模型（LLM）的能力不断提升，用户无需具备 SQL 语法知识，也可直接通过自然语言与数据库进行交互，从而生成复杂或简单的 SQL 查询并得到结果。为了让 LLM 能够在不同场景下更好地完成文本到 SQL（Text-to-SQL）的任务，各种基于 Agent 的开源框架和方法相继出现。通过与 LLM 进行 Prompt 交互，并让 Agent 访问数据库，本质上可以将“自然语言问题 → SQL查询 → 查询结果 → 最终回答”这一过程自动化。

下文将对一些主流开源框架进行比较，包括：

- **LangChain** 
- **LlamaIndex**（GPT Index 前身）
- **Wren AI**（面向企业 BI 场景的开源平台）
- 其他可能的方法和思路

并讨论其各自优缺点、适用场景、示例代码以及潜在挑战，最后会给出推荐方案和部署建议。

## 二、Text-to-SQL Agent 框架比较

### 1. LangChain

**LangChain** 是一个通用的 LLM 应用开发框架，提供了丰富的工具（Tools）和 Chain/Agent 模式。其中，对于 Text-to-SQL 主要有两个方案：

1. **SQLDatabaseChain**：  
   - 这个 Chain 可以将数据库 schema 信息和用户输入的问题一起提供给 LLM，模型生成 SQL，再执行查询并获取结果，然后反馈给用户。  
   - 使用方法非常简单，几行代码即可实现“自然语言提问 → 执行 SQL → 返回答案”的流程。  
   - 适用于“单轮问答”或相对简单的问题场景。

2. **SQL Agent（SQLDatabaseToolkit）**：  
   - 更加灵活的多工具 agent，能够在与数据库交互前先调用“列出所有表”“获取指定表信息”等工具，再由 LLM 根据上下文生成 SQL 并执行。如果报错，则能根据错误信息重新生成 SQL。  
   - 这种“ReAct” 代理模式适合多表联结或复杂查询场景，因为代理可以先了解表和列，然后逐步推理出合适的 SQL。  
   - 可以多次迭代，支持对错误进行自纠正。

**优点**：
- 与多种 LLM 接口整合（OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face、Llama CPP、Ollama等）。
- 提供了多工具 Agent，能进行多步推理、自动修正 SQL 报错。
- 社区和文档丰富，可快速找到示例和参考。
- 轻松进行组合：SQL Agent 还可与其他工具（如搜索、LLM 回答等）整合到更复杂的应用中。

**缺点**：
- 默认 prompt 和工具更倾向于 GPT-4 / ChatGPT 这类大模型，若使用小模型（如开源的 7B/13B）需要对提示词进行调整。  
- 大规模 schema（如 20+ 张表、每表几十列）时，可能会一次性把全部 schema 传给 LLM，导致 token 消耗过大，或 prompt 超限，需要自己想办法做检索式的策略。  
- 生成的 SQL 可能语法正确但逻辑错误（LLM “hallucination”），需要二次校验或限制数据库权限（如只读）。  
- 调优和测试成本较高，可能需要不断微调 prompt、限制权限及做安全检查。

### 2. LlamaIndex（GPT Index）

**LlamaIndex** 专注于将 LLM 与外部数据源连接起来，包括结构化数据（SQL 数据库）、非结构化文档或向量索引等。其内部提供了 **NLSQLTableQueryEngine** 模块，可实现自然语言到 SQL 查询。

**工作流程**：
- 将数据库的 schema 通过 `SQLDatabase` 读入，使 LlamaIndex 了解表、列和关系等信息。
- `NLSQLTableQueryEngine` 根据用户的自然语言问题，让 LLM 分析并生成 SQL，执行后再将结果交给 LLM 总结或直接返回。
- 也可将此引擎作为一个“工具”给到 Agent 使用，或直接单步调用。

**优点**：
- 专门针对结构化数据做了封装，`NLSQLTableQueryEngine` 使用非常方便，几行代码可实现 Text-to-SQL。  
- 支持 RAG（Retrieval-Augmented Generation）方式处理大规模 schema，将表结构等信息向量化，只有当问题相关时才会提供给 LLM，避免 token 浪费。  
- 如果需要把 SQL 结果与其他非结构化文本结合做回答，也可以使用 LlamaIndex 的索引能力。

**缺点**：
- 相对而言社区规模略小于 LangChain，对某些高级场景（如多次迭代对话）可能需要自己配置 agent。
- 依赖 LLM 的能力，若模型能力不足，就可能出现错误 SQL。
- 目前官方文档示例相对简单，复杂多表联结示例比较少，需要自行测试。
- 默认不会像 LangChain 的 Agent 那样一步步展示“我先列出表，再查询 schema…” 的过程，调试时可能不如 Agent 模式直观。

### 3. Wren AI

**Wren AI** 是一个针对企业级 BI 场景的开源 Text-to-SQL 平台，重点在于“即插即用”，让用户能够快速对接数据库、让 LLM 做查询，并提供可视化界面。

**主要特点**：
- 使用向量数据库存储数据库 schema 元信息，通过 RAG 的方式让 LLM 获取所需表和字段信息，而不会一次性把所有表结构都塞进 prompt。  
- 支持多种 LLM（OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic, Vertex AI等），支持本地化或云端模式。  
- 带有自己的 Web UI，让数据分析师或业务方直接通过类 Chat 界面与数据库交互，生成的 SQL 和结果会显示出来，还能生成图表。  
- 同样可以对接多种关系型数据库，包括 SQLite、PostgreSQL、MySQL、BigQuery 等。

**优点**：
- 开箱即用，无需自己写太多代码即可得到一个可用的 Text-to-SQL/BI 系统。  
- RAG 方式在处理多表复杂 schema 时效果更好，不易出现“幻觉”或大 Prompt 超限问题。  
- 具有可视化能力，可以让用户查看结果报表或图表。  
- 对企业数据场景友好，可配置权限、进行只读访问等。

**缺点**：
- 系统整体较“大”，若只想做一个最简 POC，可能反而是“杀鸡用牛刀”。  
- 需要学习和配置 Wren AI 的部署和管理，文档可能没有 LangChain/LlamaIndex 那样海量社区资源。  
- 若想在已有系统中嵌入自定义流程，需要研究其 API 接口，可能不如直接写几行代码灵活。

### 4. 其他方案与思路

- **OpenAI 函数调用 / Plugins**：可以直接用 ChatGPT 的函数调用机制，把“执行 SQL”包装成一个函数，配合数据库 schema，让 GPT-4 自动调用该函数生成 SQL 并执行。好处是无需外部框架，但需要自己写 Prompt、处理上下文和错误，某种程度上类似“造轮子”。
- **基于现有数据集微调的 NL2SQL 模型**：有一些社区开源的模型在 Spider 数据集等上做了微调，可生成较准确的 SQL。但它们通常需要完整 schema 作为输入，且不易支持多次迭代查询或者对实际数据库进行即时执行，需要额外代码集成。并且维护微调模型也非小事，可能不符合“避免造轮子”的初衷。
- **其他开源工具**：例如 Haystack、ToolLLM 等也有对应的 Text-to-SQL 模块，但普及度和成熟度不及上面几种主流方案。

## 四、示例与实现思路

下面简要展示 LangChain 和 LlamaIndex 的基本使用示例，数据库以 SQLite 为例，可替换成 PostgreSQL/MySQL：

### 示例 1：LangChain SQLDatabaseChain

```python
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain
from langchain.sql_database import SQLDatabase

# 1. 连接数据库（举例：Chinook 为示例音乐数据库）
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")

# 2. 初始化 LLM（这里使用 OpenAI GPT-4）
llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0)

# 3. 创建 SQLDatabaseChain
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)

# 4. 发送自然语言问题
question = "哪位客户在所有发票上花费最多？总金额是多少？"
result = db_chain.run(question)

print(result)
# 该 chain 会打印生成的 SQL，并给出最终答案
```

这里，SQLDatabaseChain 会自动将用户提问与数据库 schema 提供给 GPT-4，生成 SQL 并执行，然后将结果再交给 GPT-4 总结。如果要处理更复杂的场景，可使用 `SQLDatabaseToolkit` 构建 Agent。

### 示例 2：LlamaIndex NLSQLTableQueryEngine

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from llama_index import SQLDatabase, ServiceContext, LLMPredictor
from llama_index.indices.struct_store import NLSQLTableQueryEngine
from llama_index.llms import OpenAI

# 1. 创建 SQLAlchemy engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Chinook.db")
sql_database = SQLDatabase(engine)

# 2. 初始化 LLM（这里示例使用 gpt-3.5-turbo）
llm_predictor = LLMPredictor(llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0))
service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm_predictor=llm_predictor)

# 3. 创建自然语言查询引擎
nl_sql_engine = NLSQLTableQueryEngine(
    sql_database=sql_database, 
    service_context=service_context
)

# 4. 发起查询
query = "哪位客户在所有发票上花费最多？总金额是多少？"
response = nl_sql_engine.query(query)

print(response)
# 将给出文本形式的答案（或可查看内部生成的 SQL）
```

LlamaIndex 下同样可以做检索式使用，以节省 Token 并减少生成错误。在多表场景中，若 LLM 产生错误，也可以用多次尝试或增加 prompt 提示等方法改进。

### 如何在 Wren AI 中实现

Wren AI 通常作为一个服务部署，不太需要手动写很多 Python 代码，而是：

1. 配置数据库连接（SQLite 或其他关系型数据库的连接字符串）。
2. 让 Wren AI 自动解析 schema，并将其存储到向量索引中。
3. 打开 Wren 的 Web UI，与数据库对话式交互。
4. 内部使用 Agent + RAG 策略，为多表联结写出正确的 SQL 并执行，结果可视化或文本化输出。

当需要对接自定义应用时，可使用 Wren AI 提供的 API，向其发送用户查询并获取结果等。

## 五、可能的挑战与注意事项

1. **SQL 正确性**  
   LLM 并不总能 100% 生成正确 SQL，可能会拼错列名或搞错联结关系，尤其在多表复杂场景下。需要：
   - 使用只读权限避免意外写操作。  
   - 对生成的 SQL 做基础校验，如语法检查或执行错误后自动重试、修正。  
   - 针对逻辑准确性，可借助测试用例或人工审阅关键查询。

2. **多表联结的复杂度**  
   当数据库存在 20+ 张表时，可能存在大量外键、主键关系。LLM 需要理解这些关系才能正确写出联结条件。一些策略：
   - RAG 只向 LLM 提供相关表的 schema，减少干扰和 token 占用。  
   - Agent 模式可先查询表信息再逐步构建 SQL，提升成功率。  
   - 如果场景极度复杂，可尝试分段查询，再将结果聚合。

3. **上下文和提示词的长度**  
   一次性发送所有表结构到 LLM 可能导致 prompt 超限或费用高昂。RAG 或分步查询能优化这一点。

4. **查询性能和优化**  
   - LLM 仅根据语义生成 SQL，不一定是最优查询（可能写出笛卡尔积或不加索引条件）。  
   - 对大数据集要设置超时或 limit，避免查询长时间卡住。  
   - 可以让数据库本身做自动优化，也可给 LLM 提示“请在 SQL 中加上 LIMIT 1000”之类。

5. **Hallucination 和安全**  
   - LLM 可能凭空生成不存在的列或函数。若数据库报错，可回传给 Agent 让其重试。  
   - 要确保数据库用户权限安全，不给 DROP/DELETE 等敏感操作权限。  
   - 在生产环境还需处理数据访问控制，避免用户越权获取敏感信息。

6. **歧义和对话上下文**  
   自然语言往往有歧义，Agent 可能需要追问澄清，或作出默认假设。可通过多回合对话或自定义提示，让模型在不确定时发起澄清。

7. **测试与评估**  
   - 准备一批可能问题与期望答案，对生成的 SQL 结果进行对比。  
   - 如果是企业场景，可不断收集用户实际提问，分析错误案例，持续改进提示词或策略。

## 六、推荐方案与部署建议

对于需求：“需要处理多张表（20+），兼容多种 LLM，且可以先用 SQLite 做验证，后续可扩展到 PostgreSQL/MySQL”等，综合考虑推荐：

1. **若希望快速落地一个可视化的 BI 聊天式系统**  
   - **Wren AI** 非常适合，因为它内置了 RAG 解析 schema、自动生成 SQL、显示结果报表，可与多个 LLM 集成，开箱即用。  
   - 部署步骤：安装 Wren AI → 配置数据库连接（先 SQLite，后换成生产库）→ 启动服务 → 在 UI 中测试查询或通过 API 调用。  
   - 使用 GPT-4 效果最佳，如果担心成本或隐私，可尝试 Ollama + Llama2 等本地模型，但得留意性能和准确度。

2. **若想在自己应用中深度集成或只需后端“文本到 SQL”服务**  
   - 可考虑 **LlamaIndex** 配合其 `NLSQLTableQueryEngine`，并采用向量检索的方式来处理大规模表结构。  
   - 或在 **LangChain** 中使用 SQL Agent 并手动实现“只检索相关 schema”的 RAG 逻辑。  
   - 优点是更灵活可定制，但需要编写一定量的代码和 prompt。

3. **POC 快速尝试**  
   - 若数据表不算太多，可先用最直接的 **LangChain SQLDatabaseChain** 进行演示，然后再决定是否要更换到 Agent 或 Wren AI 做大规模扩展。

### 部署与实践建议

- **数据库权限**：务必使用只读账号，防止 LLM 生成破坏性语句。
- **生产环境**：可搭建只读副本，Agent 所做查询仅在副本上执行，避免对主库造成高负载影响。
- **日志与监控**：记录每次生成的 SQL 及执行耗时、错误信息等，方便诊断和优化。
- **LLM 模型选择**：  
  - 优先使用 GPT-4 等高性能模型，以提高复杂查询的正确率。  
  - 若要本地部署，可使用支持指令微调的大模型（如 Llama2 70B）来获得较高可用性，但仍需测试对多表复杂查询的准确度。  
- **持续迭代**：收集失败或不准确的查询场景，改进提示词或在 agent 中增加少量示例提示；也可对敏感列或常见多表联结做额外解释，让 LLM 理解业务逻辑。

## 七、总结

LLM 驱动的 Text-to-SQL 方法，让用户能直接用自然语言提问，而系统在后台解析并生成 SQL 执行，返回最终结果。对于数据库开发者或商业分析人员，都能显著降低使用门槛。市面上已有多个开源框架可助力快速实现此功能：

- **LangChain**：功能强大、社区成熟，可使用 SQL Agent 多步推理，适合需要灵活扩展或复杂集成的场景。
- **LlamaIndex**：提供更直接的 SQL Query Engine，并支持检索式减少无关表信息，适合专注于问答/查询的项目。
- **Wren AI**：以企业 BI 为定位，内置可视化与 RAG，支持多模型，能直接搭建面向用户的“聊数据库”平台。

在多表（20+）且需要兼容不同 LLM 的情况下，如果想要尽可能减少自行开发工作量并具备较好的可视化和协同能力，可以优先选择 **Wren AI**。如果更倾向于直接把 Text-to-SQL 能力嵌入到现有系统、且想自己精细掌控 Agent 逻辑，则可在 **LangChain** 或 **LlamaIndex** 的基础上做二次封装和检索增强。

无论选择何种方案，都需要重点关注 SQL 正确性、多表联结复杂度、上下文长度、安全权限等方面的问题，并做好持续的测试与优化。通过适当的部署配置、只读权限以及良好的日志监控，可以更稳健地在实际环境中运行 LLM Text-to-SQL 功能。
